## Welcome to My Blog 🚀

Hi, I’m Sami, a full-stack developer passionate about **frontend development (Angular, React), cloud computing, and AI**. I’m currently working remotely on cloud-based platforms while diving deeper into **LLMs, AI applications, and fine-tuning models**.

### **What You Can Expect Here**
- 🖥️ **Frontend & Full-Stack Insights** – Best practices in Angular, microservices, and cloud-native development.
- 🤖 **AI & LLM Experiments** – My journey into AI development.
- ☁️ **Cloud & Microservices** – Lessons from building scalable applications.

### **More to Come!**
This blog will serve as my **technical playground**, where I document my experiments, industry insights, and projects. If you’re interested in AI, frontend, or cloud, stay tuned!
