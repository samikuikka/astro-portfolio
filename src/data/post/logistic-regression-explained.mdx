# Logistic Regression Explained: The Math & Code Behind Classification

Logistic regression is widely used for binary classification.
This post explains its probability-based foundation, derives the gradient ascent, and shows how to implements all this in Python.

## Logistic Regression Explained

Logistic regression is an ML method used to classify data into two categories.
It's called "logistic" because it uses the logistic function to model the probability of a binary outcome.
Logistic regression tries to minimize the empirical risk.

<Latex formula="\hat{L}(w \mid D) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \log\Bigl(1 + \exp\bigl(-y^{(i)}\,h^{(w)}\bigl(x^{(i)}\bigr)\bigr)\Bigr)" />

Once we have the optimal weights, we can easily predict the class of a new data point:

<Latex formula="\hat{y} = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } h^{(\hat{w})}(x) \ge 0,\\[6pt] -1, & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}" />

Mathematically, logistic function is

<Latex formula="\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-z)}." />

Using this in logistic regression we get

<Latex formula="p(y = 1 \mid \mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x})}." />

What this means. is that the probability of a data point being in class 1 ig given by that logistic function.
Because we use logistic function for binary data (0 or 1), we can also predict the data point being in class 0:

<Latex
  formula="p(y = 0 \mid \mathbf{x}) = 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}).
"
/>

And if we have N data points, each with feature vector <InlineLatex formula="x_n" /> and label <InlineLatex formula="y_n" />, we can write the likelihood functions as:

<Latex formula="p(y_n = 1 \mid \mathbf{x}_n; \mathbf{w}) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n}}." />

and

<Latex formula="p(y_n = 0 \mid \mathbf{x}_n; \mathbf{w}) = 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n)." />

## Bernoulli Distribution

Before we can write the likelihood function, we must understand the Bernoulli distribution.
The Bernoulli distribution is a simple probability distribution for random variable that can take only two values.

The basic idea of it is that it "flips" value to 1 in probability <InlineLatex formula="p" /> and 0 in probability <InlineLatex formula="1 - p" />.

<Latex formula="p(Y = y) = p^y (1 - p)^{1 - y}, \quad \text{for } y \in \{0,1\}." />

In logistic regression, we have a similar goal, we want to predict the probability of the label being 1 or 0.
So let's use Bernoulli distribution to model the probability of the label being 1 or 0.
First we define the probability for flipping to 1 as

<Latex formula="\pi_n = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n}}." />

This is also called as the sigmoid function.
After that we can use the same logic as in the Bernoulli distribution to model the probability of the label being 1 or 0.

<Latex formula="p(y_n = 1 \mid \mathbf{x}_n; \mathbf{w}) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n), \quad p(y_n = 0 \mid \mathbf{x}_n; \mathbf{w}) = 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n)." />

This works for single data point, but we want to model the probability of the label being 1 or 0 for all data points.
Thus we can assume that each <InlineLatex formula="y_n" /> is independent of each other given the weights <InlineLatex formula="\mathbf{w}" />. So we can write the likelihood function as:

<Latex formula="p(\{y_n\} \mid \{x_n\}, \mathbf{w}) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \Bigl[ \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) \Bigr]^{y_n} \Bigl[ 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) \Bigr]^{1 - y_n}." />

This is also called as the likelihood function:

<Latex formula="\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \Bigl[ \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) \Bigr]^{y_n} \Bigl[ 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) \Bigr]^{1 - y_n}." />

However, this is a product of probabilities, which is hard to work with. So we take the logarithm of the likelihood function to get the log-likelihood function:

<Latex formula="\log \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = \log \left[ \prod_{n=1}^{N} \Bigl( \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) \Bigr)^{y_n} \Bigl( 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) \Bigr)^{1 - y_n} \right]." />

which can be further simplified using logarithmic rules to:

<Latex formula="\log \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \Bigl[ y_n \log \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n) + (1 - y_n) \log \bigl(1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n)\bigr) \Bigr]." />

## Optimization & Learning Approach

We now have our likehood function, but we need to find the weights that maximize it.
So we need to find the weights that maximize the log-likelihood function.

<Latex formula="\hat{\mathbf{w}} = \arg\max_{\mathbf{w}} \log \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w})." />

Well, now that we know what we want to maximize, we also need to find a way to do it.
This is where gradient ascent comes in.
I have written about gradient descent in my previous posts, so I won't go into too much details.
How gradient ascent differs from gradient descent is that we are trying to maximize the function, not minimize it.

<Latex formula="\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} + \eta \nabla \ell (\mathbf{w}^{(t)})," />

So our log-likehood function becomes:

<Latex formula="\ell(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \Bigl[ y_n \log \sigma(z_n) + (1 - y_n) \log \bigl(1 - \sigma(z_n)\bigr) \Bigr]," />

where

<Latex formula="z_n = \mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}." />

We need gradient of this in respect to the weights.
So let's calculate it for only single term first.

<Latex formula="\ell_n(\mathbf{w}) = y_n \log \sigma(z_n) + (1 - y_n) \log \bigl(1 - \sigma(z_n)\bigr)." />

Let's derive it in respect to the weights.

We can notice that <InlineLatex formula="z_n=w^Tx_n"/> , so by the chain rule we have

<Latex formula="\frac{\partial z_n}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \mathbf{x}_n." />

Then we can get the sigmoid function using the chain rule

<Latex formula="\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z) \bigl(1 - \sigma(z)\bigr)." />

Differentiating the first part gives us:

<Latex formula="\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \Bigl[ y_n \log \sigma(z_n) \Bigr] = y_n \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma(z_n)} \cdot \sigma'(z_n) \mathbf{x}_n = y_n \cdot \frac{\sigma(z_n) (1 - \sigma(z_n))}{\sigma(z_n)} \mathbf{x}_n = y_n (1 - \sigma(z_n)) \mathbf{x}_n." />

and the second part

<Latex formula="\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \Bigl[ (1 - y_n) \log (1 - \sigma(z_n)) \Bigr] = (1 - y_n) \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \sigma(z_n)} \cdot \Bigl[ -\sigma'(z_n) \Bigr] \mathbf{x}_n." />
<Latex formula="= -(1 - y_n) \cdot \frac{\sigma(z_n) (1 - \sigma(z_n))}{1 - \sigma(z_n)} \mathbf{x}_n = -(1 - y_n) \sigma(z_n) \mathbf{x}_n." />

Combining this result with the previous one we get:

<Latex formula="\frac{\partial \ell_n(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = y_n (1 - \sigma(z_n)) \mathbf{x}_n - (1 - y_n) \sigma(z_n) \mathbf{x}_n." />

and by factoring we finally obtain:

<Latex formula="= \Bigl[ y_n (1 - \sigma(z_n)) - (1 - y_n) \sigma(z_n) \Bigr] \mathbf{x}_n." />

Inside part of the brackets can be simplified to

<Latex formula="y_n (1 - \sigma(z_n)) - (1 - y_n) \sigma(z_n) = y_n - y_n \sigma(z_n) - \sigma(z_n) + y_n \sigma(z_n) = y_n - \sigma(z_n)." />

Thus for single point we get

<Latex formula="\frac{\partial \ell_n(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \mathbf{w}} = \bigl(y_n - \sigma(z_n)\bigr) \mathbf{x}_n." />

Now that we know how to get the gradient for a single point, we can get the gradient for the whole dataset by summing over all points:

<Latex formula="\nabla \ell(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \bigl(y_n - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\top} \mathbf{x}_n)\bigr) \mathbf{x}_n." />

Unlike gradient descent (which minimizes error), we use gradient ascent because we are maximizing the likelihood function. Thus the rule for updating the weights is

<Latex formula="\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} + \eta \sum_{n=1}^{N} \bigl(y_n - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{(t)\top} \mathbf{x}_n)\bigr) \mathbf{x}_n." />

## Implementation

Now that we have the gradient descent rule, we can implement it in Python. We will use NumPy for matrix operations.
First, let import the necessary libraries and generate some data to test our implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 200
x1_class0 = np.random.normal(loc=2, scale=1, size=(num_samples // 2, 2))
x1_class1 = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=1, size=(num_samples // 2, 2))

y_class0 = np.zeros((num_samples // 2, 1))
y_class1 = np.ones((num_samples // 2, 1))

X = np.vstack((x1_class0, x1_class1))
y = np.vstack((y_class0, y_class1)).flatten()
```

The data is visualized as follows:

<Image src={logisticRegressionData} alt="Logistic Regression Data" />

After that I preprocess the data.

```python
N = len(X)
train_ratio = 0.8
train_size = int(N * train_ratio)

indices = np.random.permutation(N)
train_idx, test_idx = indices[:train_size], indices[train_size:]
X_train, y_train = X[train_idx], y[train_idx]
X_test, y_test = X[test_idx], y[test_idx]

X_train = np.hstack((np.ones((X_train.shape[0], 1)), X_train))
X_test = np.hstack((np.ones((X_test.shape[0], 1)), X_test))

mean_X_train = np.mean(X_train[:, 1:], axis=0)
std_X_train = np.std(X_train[:, 1:], axis=0)

X_train[:, 1:] = (X_train[:, 1:] - mean_X_train) / std_X_train
X_test[:, 1:] = (X_test[:, 1:] - mean_X_train) / std_X_train
```

Notice that we add a column of ones to the data to account for the bias term in the hypothesis function.
Why is that?

The bias term is a constant that allows the model to shift the decision boundary away from the origin (0,0).
This way our decision boundary is not forced to pass through the origin, which makes the model more flexible and allows it to fit the data better.
Also, we normalize the data to have zero mean and unit variance.
This is important because it ensures that the features are on the same scale, which helps the gradient descent algorithm to converge faster.

Then we define the gradient ascent algorithm to find the optimal weights.

```python
learning_rate = 0.01
num_iterations = 1000
weights = np.zeros(X_train.shape[1])

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

for i in range(num_iterations):
    preds = sigmoid(np.dot(X_train, weights))
    gradient = np.dot((y_train - preds), X_train)
    weights += learning_rate * gradient
```

We notice that the weight update rule is same as the one in the math section!

<Latex formula="\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} + \eta \sum_{n=1}^{N} \bigl(y_n - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{(t)\top} \mathbf{x}_n)\bigr) \mathbf{x}_n." />

Let's see how well our model performs on the test set.

```python
test_preds = sigmoid(np.dot(X_test, weights))
predicted_labels = (test_preds >= 0.5).astype(int)

accuracy = np.mean(predicted_labels == y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

Accuracy: 100.00%
Works great! Our model has 100% accuracy on the test set.

I also visualized the decision boundary of our model to this picture.
